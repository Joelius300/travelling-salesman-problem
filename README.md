The idea and also the much of the algorithm itself came from [The Coding Train](https://thecodingtrain.com/). The videos I watched are [Coding Challenge #35.4: Traveling Salesperson with Genetic Algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3KTWnTrU_c) and [Coding Challenge #35.5: TSP with Genetic Algorithm and Crossover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnxn6DtLYcY).
